# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on personal data such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Project Contents

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Building models for survival prediction (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model performance evaluation

## How to Use

1. Download the training and test datasets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) from Kaggle.
2. Install the required packages:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to analyze data and build the model.

Results
Achieved an accuracy of (insert your accuracy here) in predicting passenger survival.
